#Species Distribution Modeling
##wide range of methods - science of where
##often correlates species records to environment
##alternatively, mechanistic

##used to explain species distributions/with interactions or environ
##also used to predict occurrences under conditions (ex: for conservation, in response to climate change)

##need to understand biological concepts (niche - realised vs. fundamental), biotic interactions 
##intersection of abiotic factors, biotic factors, mobility (dispersal limitations)
##ecology niche mode - predictive (response to a change) vs. SDM (shows CURRENT distribution - good to choose hotspots to protect (for ex))

##using different types of data 
###presence only, presence/absence, presence/background value, abundance
##bias present (taxonomic bias, based on accessibility/detectability)

##also environmental predictors
###can be based on resource, direct environ variables (have effect on growth/survival, ex: pH), indirect (ex: elevation)
###importnat to note scales (global dataset will lose detail, smaller scale than local area)
###check correlation (multicollinearity) between predictors

##develop SDM in three ways
###expert opinion (literature or known habitats/habitat suitability indices etc)
###correlative - most common approach (look for statistical patterns in distribution for realised niche)
###mechanistic - requires detailed physiological data, doesn't use records, talks abt fundamental niche
####choosing model based on assumptions met, type of data, etc
####robustness of prediction differs based on model chosen (GLMs, hierarchical, population modeling)

##data preparation, check assumptions, choose models, etc
##prepartion of data also depends on model chosen
##then model fitting --> assessment --> predictions and uncertainty quantification
##think about model BEFORE going to field!
