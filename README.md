# ISS_RSpatial

Long-term goals:
- To develop course for teaching spatial processing and analysis in R for undergraduates/postgraduates.

Short-term goals:
- To learn with like-minded spatial R enthusiasts under the Independent Supervised Study class.
- To use this time to think about ways to develop future course.

# Reference
Intro to GIS and Spatial Analysis by Manuel Gimond is an excellent online textbook
Source: https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/index.html

This course will be based on the chapters made available by Gimond on the above weblink.

# Appendix chapters for spatial R

I've gone over some of the R scripts under the Appendix from Gimond's online text:

A. Reading and writing spatial data in R

B. Mapping data in R

C. Anatomy of simple feature objects

D. Vector operations in R (this is very helpful and is much better than arcgis!)

F. Raster operations in R (also very helpful)

These are found on this git page.

If you are taking this class as a graduate student, please upload:
- the R tutorials on this git hub "NAME_week_X".
- the R code you use to process and analyse spatial data for your own project "NAME_project".
